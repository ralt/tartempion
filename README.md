Introduction
---

All the web frameworks out there don't suit my needs.

They're good, really, and I inspired myself from them to build `tartempion`.

But they either miss the dependency injection, or they're not decoupled enough. Or none of them.

So I built my own framework, based on [express][1] and [ncore][2].

Express is well known, it is already a web framework, and `tartempion` basically wraps express
with the dependency injection niceness that ncore provides.

### The pies concept

In tartempion, there are pies. A pie is a kind. It has its own controller, and its own model.
It has only one of them.

There, you grasped the pies concept.

`tartempion` has no way to know which pies are installed though. So you have to define them somewhere.
This somewhere is the `pies.json` file in the root folder.

This is how it is defined:

    {
        "pieName": {
            "path": "pathToPie"
        },
        "anotherPie": {
            "path": "pathToAnother",
            "dependencies": [
                "pieName"
            ]
        }
    }

Firstly, it is important to know that all the pies will remain in the `pies/` folder.

`pieName` is the name of the pie. `pathToPie` is the name of the path, not including `pies/`. Finally, `dependencies` defines the dependencies of this pie. This way, you will be able to reach `pieName`'s controller in `anotherPie`.

As simple as that.

A pie is composed of *at least* three files: `controller.js`, `model.js` and `routes.json`.

### Define some routes

All the pies define the routes they handle. They're defined in the `routes.json` file. Here is an example of such a file:

    {
        "get": [
            { "/pages": "index" },
            { "/pages/:pid": "read" },
            { "/pages/edit/:pid": "editForm" }
        ],
        "post": [
            { "/pages/edit/:pid": "edit" }
        ]
    }

As you can see, `GET` and `POST` routes are separated. You define the route to use
(express.js routes, [look here for a more thorough documentation][3]), and the function
in the controller.

For example, in the `controller.js` file of this pie, we will find this:

    module.exports = {
        index: function( req, res ) {
        },

        read: function( req, res ) {
        },

        editForm: function( req, res ) {
        },

        edit: function( req, res ) {
        }
    };

That's pretty much it about the routes.

### Control everything

Just a little while ago, you saw how a controller is defined.

More information:

- The `controller.js` file is expected to return an object having all the methods specified in the routes.
- In these methods, you have access to `this.model`. This object is the model defined in `model.js`.
- If you have defined dependencies in the `pies.json` file, you will access them using `this.pieName`.
- If you have a `setup` method or an `init` method, they will be run once when the server will start. (setup first)

### Model all the things

![Model all the things][4]

The `model.js` file is where you define the methods usable in the `controller.js` file.

This is also where you define your model. If you use mongoose, this'd be where the Schemas are defined.

### And don't worry

Then, just don't worry! The models are automatically injected in the controllers, the dependencies are injected wherever it's needed! So you don't have to worry. Just code.

Installation
---

`git clone https://github.com/Ralt/tartempion && cd tartempion && npm install`

This repository is an example. You can look around to see how it's working.
