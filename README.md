tartempion
===

Introduction
---

All the web frameworks out there don't suit my needs.

They're good, really, and I inspired myself from them to build `tartempion`.

But they either miss the injection dependency, or they're not decoupled enough. Or none of them.

So I built my own framework, based on [express][1] and [ncore][2].

Express is well known, it is already a web framework, and `tartempion` basically wraps express
with the dependency injection niceness that ncore provides.
