1. Installation
===

Installing tartempion is easy. Just run the following:

    npm install -g tartempion

Don't forget the `-g` parameter to install it globally. It may require you
to run this as root though. If you only install it locally, using the
command-line utility will be more painful. (You'll have to use it this way:
`node node_modules/.bin/tartempion`, which is a pain.)

If you want to get the last version from the git repository, here are the instructions:

    git clone https://github.com/Ralt/tartempion
    cd tartempion
    # x.y.z is the current last version
    git checkout x.y.z

tartempion's release management only uses git tags. The master branch is the one
being used for development.
