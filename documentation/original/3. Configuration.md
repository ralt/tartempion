3. Configuration
===

tartempion doesn't want you to hard-code values in your code.

So it has a `config.json` file where you can store your configuration.

The configuration is divided in 5 parts:

- `server`: about the server being run.
- `templates`: about the templates used.
- `session`: about the session used.
- `database`: about the database used.
- `test engine`: about the test engine used.

You can see an example of a basic `config.json` [here][1].

3.1. `server`
---

The `server` part has the following properties:

- `address`: the address the server listens on.
- `port`: the port the server listens on.

3.2. `templates`
---

The `templates` part has the following properties:

- `folder`: the folder in which the templates reside.
- `template engine`: the template engine used.

3.3. `session`
---

The `session` part has the following properties:

- `secret`: the secret key used to crypt your cookies.
- `maxAge`: the expire time of your sessions.

3.4. `database`
---

The `databases` part has basically one field: the name of the database
used. Depending on the database used, the properties differ.

### 3.4.1. `mongodb`

For `mongodb`, you can read [the official documentation][2]
to see what are the options.

3.5. `test engine`
---

The `test engine` part has only this property for now:

- `name`: name of the test engine used.
