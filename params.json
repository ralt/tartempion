Well, the frameworks weren't good enough for me.\r\n\r\n[express](http://expressjs.com), the best I've tried (personal opinion) is really great. It handles a lot of stuff for you, like middlewares, sessions, templates, cookies, etc. The problem when you develop on it though, is that you have to pass the app object around in arguments if you're using several files. And everybody uses several files.\r\n\r\nBesides, express doesn't dictate you an architecture. This is great since it leaves you a lot of flexibility, but it's not the fastest way to create new projects. Time is money.\r\n\r\nAnother great project I came across to is [ncore](https://github.com/Raynos/ncore). This module allows you to have a dependency injection handler. This is kind of really needed when you start having a lot of files in your project. This way, you don't have to pass the essential objects around in arguments. And we all know that global variables are evil :-).\r\n\r\nThis is why I've made `tartempion`. A module allowing you to develop websites while just caring about the business logic. You don't have to care about passing some objects in arguments, or how to create the session handler etc etc. Just set your routes, controllers and models, and you're good to go. Seriously.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n---\r\n\r\n    npm install tartempion\r\n\r\nExample app\r\n---\r\n\r\nI have written a blog using `tartempion`.
